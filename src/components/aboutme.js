        <h1>About Me</h1>
        Hello! I am Sarita. I am a web developer. I started off my career 9 years ago as an anchor and reporter in a news channel where I successfully delivered the prime-time news to the masses and worked very closely with the team of reporters. My major responsibilities were Gathering Information, Broadcasting Newscasts and Interviewing guests. Because of my verbal and communication skills, I got the opportunity to work with a coaching institute where I worked as student counselor. Again, I coordinated referrals, developed comprehensive education plans and measurable objectives for the betterment of the firm. The major accomplishment in that role that I am really proud of is, Because of my improved processes at the firm many students enrolled which improved the profitability of the firm.
<br></br>
<br></br>
I am still intrigued by learning new skills and continuing to develop inside myself. Becoming a professional web developer is equally daunting for me and an infinite opportunity to expand further.
